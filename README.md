Use visuals: Concept explanation becomes easier through diagrams and charts.
Be concise: Use short, clear sentences
## 3. How can you gauge the existing knowledge of your audience to avoid overwhelming them with jargon?
Observing the starting knowledge level helps assess a person's familiarity so begin with an approach that matches their experience.
Simple questions and examples serve to evaluate their understanding of the topic.
Consult the patient's response to change the explanation level​

## 4. What techniques can you use to ensure your content is accessible to those with limited technical knowledge?
Simple terminology replaces professional vocabulary throughout the content.

The addition of diagrams together with images helps to clarify explanations.

## 5. Why is it important to use plain language instead of technical jargon in your writing?

The simplified text enables faster comprehension of information because of its simplified wording.

## 7. How can using examples and visuals help in explaining complex concepts more clearly?
The use of examples allows students to understand abstract ideas more easily such as student's learning about functions through machine vending machine comparisons.
Through diagrams and flowcharts students can see the breakdown of procedures to minimize their confusion.
## 8. What types of visuals (e.g., diagrams, charts) are most effective for different kinds of technical information?
Diagrams: Used in illustrating system architecture.
Flowcharts: Best in describing processes or workflows.
Screenshots: Helpful in software guides.
Tables/Charts: Very useful for comparing data or summarizing key points​
